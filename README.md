# CF_cli_tool
A cli tool I created and have been using for years to make codeforces problem solving a little painless, with automated file management and template fetching.

## How to use: ##
- Clone this repo to Documents or Desktop or any other directory.
- Press Win + R, type in ```cmd``` and press Enter again.
- Using ```cd Desktop/CF_cli_tool``` or ```cd Documents/CF_cli_tool``` or ```cd your_directory/CF_cli_tool``` go inside the folder.
- Write in ```python cf.py```
- Next on follow the cli tool's instructions.
- code files will be stored in the ```./CF_cli_tool/cf_solves``` directory file.

## Feel free to improve and contribute to the tool. ##
